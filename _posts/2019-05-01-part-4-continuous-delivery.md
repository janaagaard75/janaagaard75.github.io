title: "Part 4: Continuous Delivery"
published: false

Fourth part in the series. In this part the continuous integration pipeline is upgraded to a continuous delivery pipeline, where any code pushed to GitHub is automatically deployed to a branch environment on Azure.

Until now the code has only been running locally. Instead of creating the resources manually on the Azure portal website we will be using *infrastructure as code*, and create the resources programmatically using an [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/) and a small script to publish the code.

Each branch will have an associated environment on Azure. With such a setup there is are no development, test or staging environments. There is a single production environment and a lot of branch environments. The branch environments function as development, test or whatever is required before a branch can be merged into production.

Example:

- Brach name: `4-continuous-deployment`.
- Azure resource group name: `azure-functions-typescript-4-continuous-deployment`.
- Endpoint address for the Greet function: `https://aft-rgu2ohy42laos-functions.azurewebsites.net/api/greet/`.

`rgu2ohy42laos` is a globally unique string generated by `uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)` in ARM template `azure-resources.json`. Azure requires that the names of the resources are globally unique. That includes storage accounts, that only allow up to 24 characters. With so few characters at our disposal---and no dots or hyphens---is not practical to use a domain name to namespace the resources. [`uniqueString`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions-string#uniquestring) solves the potential name collision issue, but with the downside that resources names become unreadable. The [naming convention for Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions) only suggests using the unique string when naming storage accounts, but in this template the string is used to name all the resources, just to be absolute sure to avoid a name collision.

Creating the resources on Azure is done by the shell script [`create-azure-resources.sh`](https://github.com/janaagaard75/azure-functions-typescript/blob/4-continuous-deployment/deployment/create-azure-resources.sh) that uses the [Azure Command-Line Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) (the `az` command). The resource group is created first, and then the resources described in `azure-template.json` are added to the group. The Azure CLI is idempotent, so calling the script multiple times is perfectly fine. The script runs faster if the resources already exist. If some resources have been modified, the Azure CLI will handle removing / changing / adding what is needed.

```bash
# Part of create-azure-resources.sh

# Create a resource group.
resource_group_name="azure-functions-typescript-$1"
echo "Creating resource group $resource_group_name."
az group create \
  --location "northeurope" \
  --name $resource_group_name

# Create the resources.
script_folder="$( cd "$(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE[0]})"; pwd -P )"
template_file=$script_folder/azure-resources.json
now=`date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"`
deployment_name="CircleCI-$now"
echo "Creating resources in resource group $resource_group_name with deployment $deployment_name."
az group deployment create \
  --mode Complete \
  --name $deployment_name \
  --resource-group $resource_group_name \
  --template-file $template_file \
  --verbose
```

## Asset Resource Management Template

The name of the resource group is derived from the branch name.

`uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)` is a unique 13 character string.

```javascript
// Structore of deployment/azure-resources.json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "variables": {
    // The names of the resoures are computed and store in variables.
    "appInsightsName": "[concat('aft-', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id), '-appinsights')]",
    // ...
  },
  "resources": [
    // Array with the four resources.
    {
      // TODO: What is the service plan?
      "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms",
      // ...
    },
    {
      // The storage account is where the files are kept.
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      // ...
    },
    {
      // Application Insights tracks the functions.
      "type": "Microsoft.Insights/components",
      // ...
    },
    {
      // The website hosting the functions.
      "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites",
      // This resource depends on the three others.
      "dependsOn": [
        "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('servicePlanName'))]",
        "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('storageAccountName'))]",
        "[resourceId('Microsoft.Insights/components', variables('appInsightsName'))]"
      ],
      // ...
      "properties": {
        "siteConfig": {
          "appSettings": [
            {
              "name": "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY",
              "value": "[reference(concat('Microsoft.Insights/components/', variables('appInsightsName'))).InstrumentationKey]"
            },
            // ...
          ],
          // ...
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
