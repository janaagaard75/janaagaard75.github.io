- No more than three parameters per method/function. If you have more, then create a DTO grouping some of them, or create overloaded methods. This is especially important if the parameters have the same type, e.g. strings.
- The amount of comments: Too many or too few are both a bad sign.
- Naming things. It's better to have long, descriptive names.
- Are the commits self-contained?
- Rename old stuff when introducing new stuff.
- Has the branch been rebased?
- Has the code style been respected?
- Are things being added in a sensible order, or is everything added the end of the files?
