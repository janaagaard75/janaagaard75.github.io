Fifth part of the series about Azure Function in TypeScript where we add an end-to-end test.

In the [previous step](/blog/2019-06-12-part-4-continuous-deployment) we enabled automatic creation of branch environments. Now letâ€™s write a test that verifies the actual endpoint on Azure works. We can break it down into these three steps:

1. Compute the URL our `greet` function app in Azure environment associated with the current branch.
2. Call that endpoint, fetching some data.
3. Verify that we get a 200 OK back and that the returned data is what we expected.

## Local Tests and End-to-end Tests

Our tests are currently being executed before we deploy to Azure, but since we now want to verify the deployed code, we will add a second type of test that will run after deployment. We will call the second type of tests _end-to-end tests_, and for the lack of better name, we will call the other tests _local tests_.

| Local Tests                       | End-to-end Test                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Fast.                             | Slow.                             |
| Run without deploying.            | Must deploy before running.       |
| Runs in an insolated environment. | Runs on the actual deployed code. |
{: .table .table-sm .mt-4 }

Because of the slower execution time and because a failing end-to-end tests won't stop deployment, I recommend that you write most of your tests as local tests, and only have a few end-to-end tests verifying the deployed code. The short command `test` runs the local tests.

## Getting the Root URL of Our Endpoints

`TestHelper.getApiRootUrl()` gets the root API url through the resource group. This could have been simplified a lot by simply computing the URL using the current branch name (`https://aft-${branchName}-functions/api`), but the current solution also works if `uniqueString` had been used for the name of the function app resource, and I thought that this snippet might be useful to someone, so I left it in.

1. Get the name of current branch with the shell command `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`.
2. Use the branch name to compute the name of the resource group.
3. Get a list of all the resources in that group with the shell command `az resource --list ...`.
4. The function app resource is the one with a name that matches `aft-*-functions`.
5. Return the full URL by adding `.azurewebsites.net/api`.

```typescript
private static getApiRootUrl(): string {
  const currentBranchName = this.runShellCommand(
    "git symbolic-ref --short HEAD"
  ).trim();
  const resourceGroupName = `azure-functions-typescript-${currentBranchName}`;
  const resourcesInfo = this.runShellCommand(
    `${this.azCommand} resource list --resource-group ${resourceGroupName}`
 );
  const resourceInfos = JSON.parse(resourcesInfo) as Array<ResourceInfo>;
  const functionsResourceName = resourceInfos
    .map(resourceInfo => resourceInfo.name)
    .find(
      resourceName => resourceName.match(/^aft-(.*)-functions$/) !== null
    );

  if (functionsResourceName === undefined) {
    throw new Error(
      `Could not a functions resources in the resource group '${resourceGroupName}'.`
    );
  }

  return `https://${functionsResourceName}.azurewebsites.net/api`;
}
```
